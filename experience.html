                                  My internship at Clearpath Robotics was divided two jobs, Software Development for the PR2 and Application Engineering for Clearpath's Research Solutions Team. Working at Clearpath allowed me to learn a lot about the ever growing field of robotics. Interning at Clearpath also allow me to contribute to Open Source Projects overseen by the ROS Community. There was a lot of hacking and development done which gave allowed me to acquire tons of experience in software architecture, servers, computer hardware and GPU. My roles in as an application engineer were to design the concept for new robots that would be launched under the the Research Solutions Team. The role allowed me to manage and allocate resources for future projects in the company a more business perspective to engineering.

                          Magna was my first exposure to industrial robotics. I worked for four months under the research and development department designing solutions that would benifit internal clientelle and improve manufacturing processes. My major focus was working on creating Human Machine Interface systems for operators to communicate to robots and automation stations. In addition, I got to create intelligent systems that would foolproof manufaturing errors by rapid prototyping solutions in an automation lab. I was given complete control of my projects and often found myself making most of the major development decisions and leading a small group of engineers and mechanics.

                          This was my first research and development position. As a System Integration Engineer, a large part of my job involved hacking old manually operated machines and retrofitting an automation system. Programming was done on very fast and reliable microcontrollers called PLCs. It was a very small company (only 3 people!) which meant that I took on a lot of the responsibilities of running a small business. Interestingly, I even gained a lot of mechanical knowledge and machined a lot of parts!

As a software tester in CryptoMill, I got to first hand experience with ground breaking encryption software. It was also very interesting working with Hewlett-Packard during the roll-out phase of one of the company's biggest and most succesful products.

                          Purolator was my first co-op and job experience. As a IT Intern, I built solutions of internal customers from many different departments of the company. I also worked with engineers in creating and managing databases to store corporate data used by the Board of Directors and other executives. Through Purolator, I was able to learn about working in big corporations with proper business etiquette. I learned lots and ended my term by presenting to the the directors of every major Purolator branch in North America!
