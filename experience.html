                          Magna was my latest and most extensive co-op experience. I worked for four months under the research and development department designing solutions that would benifit internal clientelle and improve manufacturing processes. My major focus was working on creating Human Machine Interface systems for operators to communicate to robots and automation stations. In addition, I got to create intelligent systems that would foolproof manufaturing errors by rapid prototyping solutions in an automation lab. I was given complete control of my projects and often found myself making most of the major development decisions and leading a small group of engineers and mechanics.
